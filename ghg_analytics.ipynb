    "In this analysis, we analyzed the implications of United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) on member states' Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). \n",
    "\n",
    "In Section 1, we combine and clean differnet data sets to get the data in useful form for the later analysis. Later we provide an overview of the world and the current situation comparing the NDCs submitted and temperature targets. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Section 2, we start focusing on the countries and the question \"Which countries are polluting more?\". We narrow down the analysis to top 10 most polluting countries and visualize their 2030 projected emissions in no policy case and their submitted NDCs. We compute their target reduction of emissions. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Section 3, we broaden our analysis with the notion of \"Historical Debt\" which is one of the important discussion points within Paris Agreement. We see the historical emissions of the top 10 emittors. Later we find the relation between their %reduction target, GDPs and cumualative emissions. With this analysis countries are grouped into four different categories in order to compare their contributions to global warming and their targets. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Section 4, we introduce the Green Climate Fund pledges and visualize how much each country pledged to contribute. We later compare this amount with the number they should contribute which is found within the analysis in this section. Following up from Section 3, \"Guilt Factor\" is used to come up with recommendations on how much top 10 emitters should contribute to the Green Climate Fund and how much their NDCs targets should be. \n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Anthropogenic climate change was first introduced into the global political arena as the United Nations Framework on Climate Change Convention (UNFCCC) in 1992. Since then, other international agreements have continued to refine mitigation action. The [United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 13](https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg13), 'Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts*', specifically targets this global issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "At 19th Conference of the Parties (to the UNFCCC) in 2013 in Warsaw, the UNFCCC members agreed to submit \"Intended Nationally Determined Contributions\" (INDCs) to signal what each country's greenhouse gas emission targets would be. At the 21st Conference in 2015, the Paris Agreement formalized these _intended_ emissions into simply \"Nationally Determined Contributions\" (NDCs).\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the signatories to the Paris Agreement (which includes all UNFCCC signatories, and therefore, all UN member nations) have agreed to maintain global warming to 2ºC, but preferrably 1.5ºC, above pre-industrial levels. This Notebook intends to analyze the NDCs to estimate their potential to reach these temperature goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "For some nations, these NDCs require a net reduction. For industrializing nations, they are simply lower than a calculated 'business-as-usual' (BAU) scenario – they are still allowed to grow their total emission footprint.\n",

    "2. If nothing changes, and the world continues doing _business as usual_ (BAU), how will the world look like in 2030?\n",

    "#### *Is it fair to put the same burden of greenhouse reduction on developing countries considering the historical emissions produced by developed countries?*\n",
    "\n",
    "Developing countries and international advocacy organization have argued that owing to their historical emissions, the developed countries owe a \"climate debt\" to poor countries (Pickering & Barry, 2012). The developed countries have enjoyed the fruit of industrial development way before the developing countries, and have used more than their fair share of Earth's ability to absorb greenhouse gases. Now, the call for reducing global emissions to combat climate change constrains the development of developing countries. Therefore, the developed countries should repay the climate debt by rapdily reducing their emissions and providing financial support to developing countries to upgrade their technologies (Pickering & Barry, 2012). \n",
    "\n",
    "The UNFCCC acknowledges this point of contention through the principle of Common but Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities (CBDR–RC) stating that the countries should *\"protect the climate system for the benefit of present and future generations of humankind, on the basis of equity and in accordance with their common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities\"* thereby urging the developed countries to take the lead on climate action (UNFCCC, 1992). The Paris Agreement also reaffirmed this obligation of developed countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the developed countries have argued to revise the crude 1992 definition of developing countries that sees 6 out of the 10 richest nations of the world as 'developing'. They have stressed that countries who are in a position to contribute financially should do so. \n",
    "\n",
    "This section analyses the cumulative historical emissions of the top polluters of the world and throws light on the their NDC reductions in relation to the cummulative emissions and GDP per capita. Further, the countries' contribution to the Green Climate Fund is analyzed to understand if the historical polluters are doing their bit to support climate mitigation in the developing countries.\n",

    "### Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "Within this notebook, we provided an overview of the major polluters responsible from climate change and analyzed the contributions of differnet countries to mitigate the climate change. We started with a holistic view on the world and the current situation related to global warming. Even in a very optimistic scenario, Nationally Determined Contributions are not enough to meet the 1.5 degrees target and countries have to do more both financially and technologically to reduce the emissions. We later narrow down our analysis to top 10 countries, what they promised and what should their contribution be. We used two criteria to calculate the required contributions: GDP per capita and historical emissions. Historical debt is still a contraversial issue within the context of climate change. We observed that most countries do not set targets in proportion with their historcial debt.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result of our final analysis (Section 4), we come up with the required contributions of the top 10 polluting countries both in terms of reductions and finances. Even though countries with high emissions try to be ambitious and set high targets, finances is very important in the whole process of emission reductions. This means countries with high GDP per capita and their contributions is the key for many countries to reach their targets. \n",
    "As the third largest emitter of the world (after China and US), India (1.2 billion population) is example of such a country. Being one of the most important actors as a developing country, India claimed that the binding commitments should be set according to past CO2 emissions of countries and rich countries must pay back their historical debt.Minster Narendra Modi states that with their restricted financial sources, their concerns are mostly over poverty and enhancing living conditions. So although India has promising renewable energy capacity it doesn’t paint a promising picture in terms of achieving its goals if there is no finnacial support. This is why they have a really low guilt factor even though their contribution to emissions is really high.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our analysis proves US is one of the key actors again both reducing emission targets and financial contributions. They are the second emittor after China with a higher historical debt than China. This puts more burden on US to put much more effort. Very contrary to these results, president of US is quoted as follows: \n",

    "\"The bottom line is that the Paris Accord is very unfair at the highest level to the United States. India will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020. India can double their coal production. We're supposed to get rid of ours.\" says Trump after stopping all contributions of the Green Climate Fund. Under Obama, the US had been intending to contribute more than $3 billion to the fund.\n",
    "\n",
    "Twenty years after the Kyoto Protocol, fossil fuels are still humanity's primary energy source which may be a sign of ineffectiveness of the protocol although it was remarkable as a first step. Next step is taken with Paris Agreement. There are still many issues to be solved related to NDCs, responsibilities or binding commitments within this complex network with many actors of different interests. \n",
